TASK 1: INVENTORY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

Overview:
This project involves developing a Python-based inventory management system for a store or warehouse. The system will provide functionalities to manage products, track inventory levels, and generate insightful reports. Additionally, features like user authentication, data validation, and a user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) will ensure accessibility and security.

Features:

User Authentication:

Implement secure login functionality.

Differentiate between user roles (e.g., Admin, Staff).

Product Management:

Add, edit, or delete product information.

Store product details like name, SKU, category, price, and quantity.

Inventory Tracking:

View current inventory levels.

Update inventory after sales or restocking.

Reports and Alerts:

Generate low-stock alerts based on pre-defined thresholds.

Produce sales summaries (daily, weekly, monthly).

Data Validation:

Ensure all inputs are correctly formatted and within valid ranges.

Graphical User Interface (GUI):

Use a library like Tkinter or PyQt for a user-friendly interface.

Allow intuitive navigation through tabs or menus.

Development Tools:

Language: Python

Libraries: SQLite (for database), Tkinter or PyQt (for GUI), Pandas (for reports)

Implementation Steps:

Define the database schema for storing product details and transactions.

Develop authentication and user role management.

Create CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for product management.

Implement inventory level tracking logic.

Design and implement the GUI.
